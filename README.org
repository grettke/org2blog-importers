* Description
  A repository for importers to orgmode format.

  Presently, only contains a script to import from WordPress to
  [[http://github.com/punchagan/org2blog][org2blog]] style posts.  It should be fairly easy to write importers
  for other formats, though.

  Licensed under GPLv3.

* Dependencies
  - [[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/][pandoc]] v1.8 or greater
  - argparse (needs to be installed if Python v<2.7)
